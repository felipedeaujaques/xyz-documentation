# Tags

To work efficiently with data, it is often necessary or helpful to sub-divide a data. Spaces allow you to do this with the help of tags. A Tag is a text that can be used with a subset of the data. Tags are optional for you or the owner of the Space you are working with.

You might want to use different tags for the different ways you want to use or style data. For example, you might want to tag the Store location you are putting in a layer with the amenities that the particular store provides (coffee, food, late_night). In addition you could use new as a tag for newly opened stores you want to highlight and call out on the map.
