## Create a project

To create a project, name your map and add a description. You can also select a basemap, which is the background on which _your_ map is drawn. There are a number of themes available.

You should give your map a good name and also a description, in case you forget later what you wanted to show.

You can also pick a basemap - the background on which _your_ map will be drawn. There are a number of themes available (and more will be coming).
Simply select one you like best for your project.

## Create your content

To create your content, add a layer to the map. A layer can contain 
_Points_, _Lines_, and _Polygons_ (collectively called _Features_ ) that can be colored and styled.

Think of a _Layer_ as a transparent sheet that covers the whole map on which you can draw features.

## Load other content

A powerful feature of Here Studio is that you do not have to create all the content yourself. You can find open map data on the internet.

`GeoJSON` is a common format for geospatial data. If you find something you want to use, you can _upload_ the data into Here Studio. For example, you might want to highlight all the [**bike paths**](https://data.sfgov.org/Transportation/Map-of-SFMTA-Bikeway-Network/ccs9-xdqj) on a map.

## Share the map

You can get an interactive link to your map that can be easily
shared via email, twitter or any messenger app. Turn
on publishing and copy the URL to _Your Map_.

> #### Tip
>
> You can share a map and still continue to work on it. You do not have to send a new URL. Recipients will always see the most up-to-date map.
