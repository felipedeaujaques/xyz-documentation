# Navigate

In this section, we'll explain the main _Dashboard_ with the _Project_ and _Data Hub_ tabs and describe the available options. Then we will review a project and learn how to navigate between _Layers_ as
well as different views, such as _Map_ view and _Data_ view. 

## Dashboard

### Projects

The dashboard is the main landing page after you log in and 
shows you a overview of all your projects. It contains a summary of
your project with its settings and a small thumbnail of the map. You can also determine if it has been published.

If you have several projects, organizer 
functions appear that help you get an overview or search.

See the following video overview:

### Data Hub

The **Data Hub** lists all datasets you can access and use directly
in projects. You can narrow down the list by _searching_ for a specific dataset and upload data as a new dataset.

You can also manage your data, upload new datasets, edit entries, delete complete datasets and download a file of the content stored in the cloud.

## Project

### Map View

You can navigate the map using the mouse, changing the view
by _dragging_ the map and using the _zoom control_ (or the mouse wheel) to zoom nearer or father away from the map. You can also **search** for cities and places by using the search bar.

See the following video overview:

### Map Bookmarks

As your map becomes larger and the data more complex, you can  _switch_ between different pre-defined map views. In each
project you can define your own **location bookmarks** and switch 
between them.
